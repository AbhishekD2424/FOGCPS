The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to massive amounts of data generated at the edge of networks. In response, Fog Computing and Cyber-Physical Systems (FogCPS) have emerged as a groundbreaking solution, bridging the gap between cloud and edge computing. FogCPS is a decentralized computing architecture that extends the capabilities of cloud computing to the edge of the network. By distributing computing resources closer to where data is generated, FogCPS significantly reduces latency, improves response times, and enhances the overall efficiency of data processing. It enables real-time analysis and decision-making, crucial for time-sensitive applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and healthcare monitoring systems.Moreover, FogCPS optimizes network bandwidth utilization by offloading computationally intensive tasks from the cloud to the edge devices. This distributed computing approach not only alleviates the strain on centralized servers but also enhances data privacy and security by keeping sensitive information closer to its source. The integration of FogCPS into our technological landscape holds tremendous potential for various industries. It empowers businesses to harness the full potential of IoT by leveraging the advantages of both cloud and edge computing. FogCPS is revolutionizing the way we process and analyze data, enabling a future where intelligent systems seamlessly interact with the physical world.
