# FOGCPS
Created an entire Fog-enabled Cyber-Physical System, based on many theoretical research papers, like the 'Fog-CPS.pdf' paper uploaded in the repository. Utilizing the Pairing Based Cryptography(PBC) library created a system of machines that could communicate and interact via encrypted messages, shared via UDP connection, which were encrypted using ECC encryption and tag generation methodology.

NOTE: READ THE 'makefile' TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
